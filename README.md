# Naitik Gupta | Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built using React.js and modern web technologies. It highlights my background, skills, projects, education, achievements, and contact information. The design is responsive and includes subtle 3D and animation effects to create a dynamic user experience.

The portfolio reflects my journey as a full stack web developer and programmer, and serves as a central place for anyone looking to know more about my work or get in touch.
